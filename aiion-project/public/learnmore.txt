   "The website is designed to facilitate user engagement by allowing individuals to input their water geochemical data. Upon submission, the model will provide a predicted subsurface temperature, making it a valuable tool for researchers, engineers, and stakeholders in the geothermal industry. This interactive feature enhances accessibility to advanced geothermal analysis.​",
   "The geothermometer model operates by processing input data, including cations, anions, pH, and ionic strength. The deep neural network analyzes these variables to generate a temperature prediction. This process involves complex algorithms that have been fine-tuned through rigorous training on historical data, ensuring reliable outputs.​ This geothermometer model has a wide range of applications in geothermal exploration and development. It can assist in the selection of drilling sites, improve the understanding of geothermal systems, and support the decision-making process for energy projects. By providing accurate temperature predictions, the model helps optimize resource management.​",
   "The model was trained using a comprehensive dataset derived from geothermal sites in the state of Nevada, USA. This dataset consists of a variety of thermal and geochemical measurements, including pH, Na, K, Ca, Mg, SiO2, Cl, and temperature, which are critical for developing a robust predictive model. The quality and diversity of the training data contributed significantly to the accuracy and reliability of the model. The effectiveness of the geothermometer model is evaluated using statistical metrics such as R² (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (root mean square error). High R² values (0.9689) indicate a strong correlation between predicted and actual temperatures, while low RMSE values (7.1734) reflect minimal prediction errors. These metrics validate the model's performance in real-world applications.​​",
   "Looking ahead, there are opportunities to expand the model's capabilities by incorporating additional data types and refining its algorithms. Future research may focus on enhancing the model's predictive power and exploring its applicability in different geological settings. Continuous improvement will ensure the model remains a cutting-edge tool in geothermal energy exploration.​"
