"Solute geothermometers have been used for many years to estimate geothermal reservoir temperatures as a low-cost alternative to exploratory drilling.​",
"Classical geothermometers are common tools to infer the temperature of high-temperature geothermal reservoirs, in which the geothermal waters reach chemical equilibrium with various aluminosilicates minerals, such as K-feldspar or albite (Fournier, 1977, 1981; Giggenbach et al., 1983; Giggenbach, 1988, among many others). However, this type of geothermometers usually fail in accurately estimating the temperature of low-medium temperature geothermal reservoirs.",
"This situation provides ideal starting conditions for the application of machine learning algorithms to support geothermal exploration. AiION was developed during the Ph.D. of Mahmoud M. AlGaiar at Robert Gordon University with the aim of developing a reliable data-driven geothermometer using a supervised machine learning methodology to predict subsurface temperatures in deep geothermal fields based on input geochemical data.​",
"The research followed a structured approach that involves preprocessing subsurface data, engineering features, training models, and conducting rigorous validation and testing procedures. Its primary focus is on managing geochemical and thermal databases, which involves collecting, visualizing, organizing, maintaining, and validating major cations, major anions, trace elements, Ionic Strength, pH, and temperature data from various sources. The collective dataset undergoes statistical checks to ensure its suitability for training the geothermometer model. In the next step, clustering analyses such as k-means and hierarchical clustering are applied to identify patterns and relationships within the geochemical and thermal data. This step provides a deeper understanding of the data structure and helps uncover valuable insights that can enhance the model's predictive capabilities. In addition, GIS representation techniques are used to visually represent the results of the clustering analysis in a spatial manner. This provides a clear view of the data distribution and helps in the effective interpretation of the results.​",
"Finally, the collective dataset is used to train the model with supervised predictive modelling techniques, such as Regression Modelling, Xtreme Gradient Boosting, ANN, and Deep Learning. These techniques were chosen for their proven performance in similar applications and their potential to provide accurate predictions in the field of geothermal exploration. Model evaluation involved using appropriate metrics and techniques, such as cross-validation and accuracy measures, to assess the performance and accuracy of each predictive model in predicting subsurface temperatures. Model testing was then conducted against actual data to ensure accuracy and reliability. The integration of these tools aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of subsurface temperature estimation, thereby contributing to advancements in geothermal exploration practices.​"
