    "question": "What is AiION?",
    "answer": "AiION is an advanced artificial neural network solute geothermometer designed to predict the subsurface temperature of deep geothermal reservoirs. It utilizes a supervised feedforward multilayer perceptron to analyze fluid chemistry and generate accurate temperature predictions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does AiION work?",
    "answer": "AiION processes geochemical data, including cations, anions, pH, and ionic strength, using complex algorithms trained on historical data. This allows it to predict reservoir temperatures effectively, aiding in the exploration of geothermal resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What programming languages and libraries does AiION use?",
    "answer": "AiION is developed in Python 3.8.5 and employs several libraries including NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras for its functionalities."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I input data into AiION?",
    "answer": "For single inputs, users can enter their geochemical data directly in &quot;The Model&quot; tab. For multiple inputs, a CSV file formatted according to a provided template is required."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the effectiveness of AiION evaluated?",
    "answer": "The model's performance is assessed using statistical metrics such as R² (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (root mean square error). High R² values (0.9689) indicate strong correlations between predicted and actual temperatures, while low RMSE values (7.1734) reflect minimal prediction errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is geothermal resource exploration critical?",
    "answer": "As global energy demands rise, exploring deep geothermal resources becomes essential for sustainable energy production. Understanding subsurface conditions is vital for successful geothermal project development and resource management."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the future plans for AiION?",
    "answer": "Future enhancements may include incorporating additional data types and refining algorithms to further improve predictive accuracy and expand applicability across different geological settings."
